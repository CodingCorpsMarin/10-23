We just put AJAX/jQuery onto a prebuilt Sinatra application.
Now we will be doing that same thing, but building the Sinatra app ourselves.
First, we will be building out a Craigslist Clone: https://github.com/CodingCorpsMarin/craigslist-jr-challenge
Use what we learned and remember from Sinatra to build a fully functional application.
Then we will add jQuery and AJAX elements for adding articles.

Building out the Sinatra application will probably take the whole first day and maybe even more, so get in some practice!
